Business Impact Proposal: Automated Practitioner Credentialing
1. Headline
HOMELINK's credentialing team processes ~30 packets per week per specialist. With 16,000 DME providers now requiring annual recredentialing (per the new CMS final rule) and a growth mandate of 10,000–15,000 new providers per year, the math doesn't work: 4 specialists cannot handle 31,000+ packets annually. A CVO partnership with Verifiable eliminates this gap, reduces the credentialing team from 4 FTEs to 1 FTE of effort, and cuts provider application time from 4 hours to 25 minutes — without hiring a single additional credentialer over the next 3 years.

2. Key Challenges
Current reliance on manual, antiquated processes creates a 40–60 day credentialing bottleneck that prevents network scalability, drives provider attrition, and consumes the full bandwidth of a 4-person team. The recent CMS final rule reducing the DME recredentialing cycle from 3 years to 1 year has tripled recredentialing volume overnight — the current team would spend the entire year just recredentialing existing DME providers with no capacity for new provider intake. Without access to CAQH or automated primary source verification, HOMELINK faces mounting compliance exposure, including retro billing financial losses from sanctioned/unlicensed providers slipping through manual gaps.

3. Recommended Approach
Partner with Verifiable as a full CVO (Credentials Verification Organization) to completely outsource primary source verification, continuous sanction monitoring, and provider credentialing. Verifiable's CredAgent AI — a differentiating capability unique to this platform — automates verification across 3,200+ data sources, while API integration into iVGM eliminates manual data entry and establishes a NCQA-compliant audit trail.

4. Target Outcomes

Annual New Providers      10,000–15,000         10,000–15,000
Annual Provider Hours     40,000–60,000 hrs     4,167–6,250 hrs
Annual Provider Hours     —                     35,833–53,750 hrs saved
  Saved
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Note: Faster onboarding directly reduces provider drop-off. Current 40–60 day turnaround causes providers to spin out before receiving a single referral. A 1–3 day turnaround eliminates this attrition risk.

4b. Team FTE Demand & Savings (3-Year Projection)

Assumptions:
- Specialist capacity: 30 packets/week avg × 50 working weeks = 1,560 packets/year per FTE
- DME recredentialing: 16,000 providers/year (1-year cycle per CMS final rule)
- Non-DME recredentialing: remaining providers on 3-year cycle
- New provider intake: 12,500/year (midpoint of 10,000–15,000 target)
- Salary: $60K avg per credentialer (excludes benefits, training, overhead)

*  Today's recreds: 42,000 providers / 3-year cycle = ~14,000/year (pre-CMS rule change)
†  Current new provider pace: ~8,400/year (4,200 added Jun–Dec per Derek)
‡  Year 1 recreds: 16,000 DME (now annual) + 38,500 non-DME / 3 = ~24,700
§  Year 2 recreds: 16,000 DME + 51,000 non-DME / 3 = ~26,900 (non-DME grows with network)
¶  Year 3 recreds: 16,000 DME + 63,500 non-DME / 3 = ~29,200

Key takeaway: Even hiring 2 credentialers per year, the team never comes close to meeting demand.
By Year 1, they need 24 FTEs but will only have 6 — a gap of 18 specialists.
By Year 3, they need 27 FTEs but will only have 10 — still 17 specialists short.

Key insights:
- HOMELINK is already 10 FTEs short TODAY, before any growth or CMS rule change impact.
- The realistic hire pace of +2/year never closes the gap — the team stays 17–18 specialists short every year.
- Even at the realistic hire pace, the status quo costs $1.44M in FTE salary over 3 years and still fails to meet demand.
- If fully staffed to demand, the 3-year FTE cost would be $4.56M — making the CVO investment a fraction of the true alternative.
- With Verifiable CVO, 1 FTE of oversight handles 100% of demand at any volume, at $60K/year.
- The 3 freed credentialers are redeployed to provider relations and other high-value work — not terminated.

5. Cost of Inaction
Risk: The DME recredentialing cycle reduction from 3 years to 1 year (CMS final rule, effective 2025) means 16,000 DME providers now need annual recredentialing. At the current team average of 30 packets/week across 4 specialists (~6,240/year capacity), the team would spend the entire year on recredentialing alone — with zero capacity for new provider intake or growth.

Compliance Exposure: Without real-time sanction monitoring, HOMELINK continues to risk claims on unlicensed/sanctioned providers. Current quarterly checks (at best) have already resulted in providers operating without valid licenses for months, with payers discovering the gaps. A single incident costs $12.5K+; annual exposure runs 6–7 figures.

Hiring Spiral: HOMELINK is already 10 FTEs short of meeting current credentialing demand. Growing the network from 42K to 84K providers over 3 years would require 24–27 FTEs ($4.56M in salary over 3 years) to fully staff to demand. Even at a realistic hiring pace of +2/year (reaching 10 FTEs by Year 3), the team remains 17+ specialists short — still behind with 40–60 day turnaround times, still without CAQH access, and still not compliant with the 1-year DME recred requirement.

Provider Attrition: The current 40–60 day credentialing window causes direct provider loss. Providers sign contracts but spin out before receiving a single referral. Providers with multiple TINs refuse to credential beyond the first because the application process takes 2–8 hours per TIN.

Opportunity Cost: Inability to intake 10,000–15,000 new providers per year creates a bottleneck that directly threatens the 3-year network expansion goal of doubling to 84,000+ providers.

6. Value Proposition
Financial Impact: Avoid $1.26M–$4.38M in cumulative hiring costs over 3 years (the range depends on whether HOMELINK hires at the realistic pace of +2/year or fully staffs to demand). Eliminate 6–7 figure annual retro billing losses. Prevent revenue leakage from delayed provider activation.

Strategic Impact: Achieve NCQA compliance with built-in audit trails. Meet the new CMS 1-year DME recredentialing mandate without additional resources. Position HOMELINK as a scalable, compliant partner for major payers. Enable provider network to double from 42K to 84K+ without proportional cost increase.

Operational Impact: Reduce credentialing cycle from 40–60 days to 1–3 days. Reduce provider application time from 4 hours to 25 minutes. Reduce credentialing team from 4 FTEs to 1 FTE of oversight work. Gain access to CAQH and 3,200+ primary sources currently unavailable. Enable real-time continuous sanction monitoring replacing quarterly manual checks.

Competitive Differentiation (CredAgent AI): Verifiable's CredAgent provides AI-powered autonomous credentialing that handles volume spikes, accelerates throughput during peak growth periods, and continuously improves accuracy — a capability that creates meaningful separation from alternative CVO providers.

7. Urgency & Timeline
CMS Mandate: The DME recredentialing cycle is now 1 year (down from 3). This rule is final and in effect. HOMELINK's 16,000 DME providers must be recredentialed annually starting now — the current team cannot meet this obligation.

Growth Clock: 10,000–15,000 new providers are targeted for this year alone, with the same volume each subsequent year. Every month without a CVO partner is a month the backlog grows and providers are lost to competitors.

Decision Window: Budget has already been allocated based on the higher of the two vendor proposals. The question is no longer whether to invest, but how quickly HOMELINK can begin realizing the operational, compliance, and financial benefits.
